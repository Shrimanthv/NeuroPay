## Overview
NeuroPay is an AI-powered salary prediction system that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression model to estimate salaries based on user inputs such as experience, education, and job title. Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, the application provides accurate and real-time salary predictions through an intuitive web interface. It helps job seekers, HR professionals, and recruiters make informed decisions with data-driven insights.

## Motivation
In todayâ€™s competitive job market, understanding fair salary expectations is challenging for both job seekers and employers. Salary transparency is often limited, making it hard to make informed career or hiring decisions. NeuroPay was created to bridge this gap using machine learningâ€”providing accurate salary predictions based on real data. The goal is to empower users with insights that help set realistic expectations and support better negotiation and planning.
